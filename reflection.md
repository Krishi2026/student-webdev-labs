### Accessibility

**01-html**

All four exercises have been assessed for accessibility using both the Wave extension and the W3C Markup Validation tool for HTML. No errors were found during these evaluations. However, it seems that the link provided for loading the puppy images in the "02-images.html" exercise may no longer be valid, resulting in the webpage failing to display any puppy images. This issue could potentially impact accessibility. Please advise on an alternative link to resolve this matter.

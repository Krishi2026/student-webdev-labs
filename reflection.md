## Reflection Document

### HTML

**01-html**

❏ Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
videos or the solutions for help?

->I did it on my own but later saw your videos to check for safety

❏ How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
exercise that was particularly helpful?

->Starting with the fundamental HTML components and their layouts was made very easy with the help of the exercises in this part. The form exercise was especially beneficial to me since it clarified the meaning of each of the various features and attributes that make up a form and their respective functions.

❏ Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

->No everything looks perfect to me

❏ Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s
topic a little better?

->No 


### Accessibility

All four exercises have been assessed for accessibility using both the Wave extension and the W3C Markup Validation tool for HTML. No errors were found during these evaluations. However, it seems that the link provided for loading the puppy images in the "02-images.html" exercise may no longer be valid, resulting in the webpage failing to display any puppy images. This issue could potentially impact accessibility. Please advise on an alternative link to resolve this matter.
